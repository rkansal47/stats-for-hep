# Stats for HEP

This is a series of walk-throughs of some concepts in statistics relevant for high energy physics (HEP). 
It is primarily based on (me trying to understand) Refs. {cite}`Cowan:2010js` and {cite}`Cranmer:2014lly`, and whatever the CMS combine tool is doing.
Both references are useful and highly recommended for reading; the emphasis here is heavily on **implementing and visualizing what they discuss in Python** - as well as providing some heuristic derivations of some of their formulae - as that is what personally helped me build an intuition for these concepts.
Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/rkansal47/stats-for-HEP/issues/new) on Github if you find an error or something is not clear!

Coming soon:

7. Asymptotic formulae for signal discovery and limit-setting


<!-- Part 1: introduces the ideas of likelihoods and test statistics, using a simple toy example.

Part 2: discusses the framework for hypothesis testing and $p$-values and significances, following the same toy example.

Part 3: frequentist confidence intervals and upper limits.

Part 4: expected significance and limits.

Part 5: asymptotic form of the MLE.

Coming soon...

Part 6: asympotic form of profile-likelihood-ratio-based test statistics.

Part 7: significances and limits using asymptotic formulae.
