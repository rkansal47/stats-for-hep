# Stats for HEP

This is a series of walk-throughs of some concepts in statistics relevant for high energy physics (HEP). 
It is primarily based on (me trying to understand) Refs. {cite}`Cowan:2010js` and {cite}`Cranmer:2014lly`, and whatever the CMS combine tool is doing.
Both references are useful and highly recommended for reading; the emphasis here is heavily on **implementing and visualizing what they discuss in Python**, as that is what ultimately helped me build any intuition about these concepts.

The plan is as follows:

Part 1: introduces the ideas of likelihoods and test statistics, using a simple toy example.

Part 2: discusses the framework for hypothesis testing and $p$-values and significances, following the same toy example.

Part 3: frequentist confidence intervals and upper limits.

(Coming soon)

Part 4: expected significance and limits.

Part 5: asymptotic formulae.

Part 6: binned fits using zfit...
