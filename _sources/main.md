# Stats for HEP

This is a series of walk-throughs of some concepts in statistics relevant for high energy physics (HEP). 
It is primarily based on (me trying to understand) Refs. {cite}`Cowan:2010js` and {cite}`Cranmer:2014lly`, and the CMS combine tool {cite}`CMS:2024onh`.
Both references are useful and highly recommended for reading; the emphasis here is heavily on **implementing and visualizing what they discuss in Python** - as well as providing some heuristic derivations of some of their formulae - as that is what personally helped me build an intuition for these concepts.

These notes are primarily intended to be followed interactively [online](https://rkansal47.github.io/stats-for-hep) as Jupyter notebooks, but are also available as a [PDF](https://github.com/rkansal47/stats-for-hep/blob/gh-pages/stats-for-hep.pdf?raw=true).
Feedback and corrections are very welcome through e-mail or as [issues](https://github.com/rkansal47/stats-for-hep/issues) on [Github](https://github.com/rkansal47/stats-for-hep/).
Finally, for those interested, some more notes and tutorials I have written up, such as on the standard model and machine learning in HEP, are available [here](https://rkansal47.github.io/).
