## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the Stats for HEP book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `stats-for-hep/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean stats-for-hep/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build stats-for-hep/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `stats-for-hep/_build/html/`.
